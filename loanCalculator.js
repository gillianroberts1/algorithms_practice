/*



interst rate is calculated per year(12months)
interest rate:
0 - 1000 => 5%
1001 - 5000 => 4%
5001 - 10000 => 3%


the code should take a user input asking
1. how much they want to borrow
2. loan term in years
3. interst rate

It should return 
1. monthlhy payments
2. total interest 
3. total to pay (loan amount + interest)

example :
loan amount = 1000
term = 1year

interest for term = 1000 * 0.05
